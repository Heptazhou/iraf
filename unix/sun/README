GTERM/IMTOOL installation instructions for SUN/IRAF V2.5
------------------------------------------------------

To save memory, GTERM is linked with the other, standard SUN tools in the
executable /usr/bin/suntools.  A copy of this file with GTERM linked in is
in $iraf/local/suntools.  To install it, do the following.

	% cd $hlib
	% su
	% install

or, if you don't have the IRAF 'install' script or are not installing IRAF,

	% su
	% cd /usr/bin
	% mv suntools suntools.ORIG
	% cp $iraf/local/suntools .
	% ln -s /usr/bin/suntools gterm
	% ln -s /usr/bin/suntools imtool
	%
	% cd /usr/lib
	% (add entries for gterm, imtool to the default rootmenu)
	% 
	% cd /usr/man/manl
	% ln -s $iraf/sun/gterm.man gterm.l
	% ln -s $iraf/sun/imtool.man imtool.l
	% #(you may also with to run catman)

There is little reason not to go ahead and replace the standard 'suntools'
executable with the one we supply, since all the old tools are still available,
and the new executable is only slightly larger than the old one.  If you do
not want to do this however, no problem, just install the executable with a
different name and use the -s option when bringing up suntools to specify the
name of the custom executable.  Since full sources and binaries are also
supplied, it is also possible for the knowledgeable user to link their own
custom suntools executable containing other custom tools.

This suffices to install GTERM in SUN/UNIX.  Before using it, it is also
desirable to configure some setup files in the user's login directory.
This is best done by copying the following files to your login directory,
and modifying them:

	$iraf/local/.defaults
	$iraf/local/.suntools
	$iraf/local/.ttyswrc

These should actually work without modification, but you might want to
comment out (# ...) the final two "perfmeter" windows in the .suntools file.
The .suntools provided should serve only as an example; the window layout
generally needs to be customized for every application and every user.

# There is no GTERM manual page yet.  [THERE IS NOW - gterm.man]
# Contact us for instructions on using GTERM. 
Very briefly, GTERM is a tektronix compatible virtual graphics terminal with
independent text and graphics planes.  There is nothing in GTERM which ties it
to IRAF, and indeed it is upwards compatible with SHELLTOOL (with many added
features such as graphics), and can be used in place of SHELLTOOL.  Note that
there is a special frame menu which can be used to enter 'setup' mode, or to
make hardcopies of various windows or the full screen on an Apple Laserwriter
(or other Postscript driven device).  Setup mode can be used to change the size
of the graphics window and other options.  Virtually all of the options can
also be set on the command line when the tool is started; a -G separates the
frameargs for the text window from those for the graphics window.  For the
names of the special GTERM options, page the gterm.c source file.

The .ttyswrc file defines a number of function keys (F8,F9,R1,R2,R3) which are
recognized by the GTERM text window, and also by the standard shelltool.
R[1-3] are used to size the GTERM text window to 24, 34, or 40 lines; e.g.,
R3 will set the window size to 40 lines, and a 'stty gterm40' should be typed
into the CL to tell it that the window size has changed.  There are also
entries for 'gterm24' and 'gterm34'; other sizes are possible if you
explicitly set 'ncols' and 'nlines' in STTY.  F8 clears the graphics plane
and leaves the terminal in graphics mode; subsequent text will come out in the
graphics plane.  F9 restores the terminal to text mode, or if already in text
mode, clears the text window.  When using GTERM with arbitrary (non-IRAF)
graphics programs, it may be necesssary to manually place the terminal in
graphics mode with F8 before drawing a plot, to get everything to work right.

When reading the cursor in graphics mode, note that after typing a key in
response to a cursor request, you can 'alias' that key to a mouse button by
holding down the control key and tapping the desired mouse button twice.
Thereafter, the mouse button may be used in place of the keyboard key to
terminate a cursor read, transparently to the applications program.  This is
very useful for repetitively marking object positions in a graphics cursor
loop.


IMTOOL installation instructions.
-------------------------------------

A crude early version of the IMTOOL prototype image display server is included
in the suntools executable.  This is a very limited program at present, however
it can display an image.  Lookup table adjustment (tap the right mouse button
a couple times and hold it down while moving the mouse) and linear and random
pseudocolor (settable in 'setup' mode) are also provided.  PLEASE NOTE THAT
THIS IS A CRUDE EARLY VERSION OF THE SUNVIEW DISPLAY SERVER, AND A MUCH MORE
CAPABLE PROGRAM IS PLANNED FOR LATER THIS YEAR.  In particular, we are well
aware of the need for interactive cursor readback, which is not yet available
for imaging devices.

Installation is the same as for GTERM, except for the following additional
steps:

	% su
	% cd /dev
	% /etc/mknod imt1 p
	% chmod 777 imt1
	%
	% cd /usr/bin
	% ln -s /usr/bin/suntools imtool

There is no entry for IMTOOL in the default .suntools provided; to start up
IMTOOL use the mouse, or type the 'imtool' command into the cshell.  The IRAF
DISPLAY program in the TV package may be used to display images (device=imtool).
CVL cannot be used, nor can anything else in the TV package except DISPLAY.
DISPLAY can only be used to write full image frames.  If a laserwriter is
available, pseudo-greyscale hardcopy is available via frame menu selection.
Note that it takes the laserwriter about 5 minutes to render a pseudo-greyscale
hardcopy, but it only takes a few seconds to capture the screen and queue the
job to the laserwriter.
