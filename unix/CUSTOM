BSD UNIX/IRAF HSI.  This version was generated from the Sun/IRAF HSI.
This file records the changes required to convert the Sun HSI to BSD.
Begun Sunday 9 April 1989.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

unix.n/
	Copied in a source only version of the Sun HSI, leaving the BSD HSI
	intact.

unix/as
unix/mkpkg.sh
	1. Removed the symbolic link "as" and replaced it by a copy of the
	directory as.vax.
	2. Commented out the code in mkpkg.sh which recreates the link as at
	boot time, based on the machine type (which is always a VAX for BSD).
	Also commented out the SHLIB entries.

unix/os/zzstrt.c
	Added a #ifdef sun for some #includes that are only required for
	shared libraries, and that reference files that only exist in SunOS.

unix/hlib/libc/iraf.h
	Added a couple #defines (UNIX, BSD43) that were present in the old
	BSD hsi; commented out the SUNOS4 define.

unix/hlib/libc/spp.h
	Replaced with old version which contains VAX machine constants.

unix/hlib/irafuser.csh
	Commented out the `mach` and replaced with "vax".  Replaced a second
	occurrence of `mach` by $MACH.

unix/hlib/i1mach.f
unix/hlib/r1mach.f
unix/hlib/d1mach.f
unix/hlib/config.h
unix/hlib/mach.h
	Replaced by old vax versions.

unix/hlib/extern.pkg
unix/hlib/motd
unix/hlib/zzsetenv.def
unix/hlib/mkpkg.inc
unix/hlib/mkiraf.csh
unix/hlib/install
unix/hlib/mkpkg.sf.VAX +
	Modified for the VAX.

-----------------
Begin NOVOS bootstrap of HSI.

unix/os/zfiobf.c
	#ifdef-ed the #include <fcntl.h>.

unix/os/zmaloc.c
	Replaced by old VAX version which has a custom memory allocator,
	since we don't want to use the BSD 4.3 allocator which can't free
	large blocks of memory.

unix/hlib/libc/xnames.h
	Deleted definition of AMOVC - already defined in knames.h.

unix/hlib/cl.csh
	Removed the `mach` references and replaced by $MACH.

unix/boot/bootlib/osputenv.c
	BSD has no putenv call, but instead a similar setenv, so I had to
	add a #ifdef vax to have it both ways.

unix/boot/spp/xc.c
	Made no shared library (-z) the default for BSD.
