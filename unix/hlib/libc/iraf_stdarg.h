/* STDARG.H -- Interface to the Unix variable argument-list interface.
 * This version replaces <varargs.h>, but is NOT backwards compatible.
 *
 * We pick up the local UNIX definitions for dealing with a variable
 * number of arguments.  This is done via indirection through this file so
 * that any problems can be dealt with by changing only this file.
 *
 * Usage: Include this file using import_stdarg.
