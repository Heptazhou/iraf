# System error message file.  Messages may appear in any order; error
# codes must be left justified and must agree with those defined in
# <syserr.h>.  System error codes start at 500; 1-499 are reserved for
# applications and user programs.  It is wise to reserve a lot of extra
# error codes for each package.
