NAME
msieval -- procedure to evaluate the interpolant at x and y
.ih
SYNOPSIS
y = msieval (msi, x, y)

.nf
pointer		msi		# interpolant descriptor
real		x		# x value, 1 <= x <= nxpix
real		y		# y value, 1 <= y <= nypix
.fi
.ih
ARGUMENTS
.ls msi    
The pointer to the sequential interpolant descriptor structure.
.le
.ls x, y
The x and y values of the point to be evaluated.
.le

DESCRIPTION
The polynomial coefficients are calculated from the data points in the
case of the polynomial interpolants and the B-spline coefficients in
the case of the spline interpolant. The polynomial interpolants
are evaulated using Everett's central difference formula.

NOTES
Checking for out of bounds and INDEF valued pixels is the
responsibility of the user. MSIINIT and MSIFIT must be called before using
MSIEVAL.
