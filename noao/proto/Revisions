    Valdes, June 13, 1989
    New task IMEXAMINE added to the proto package.

noao$proto/tvmark/
    Davis, June 6, 1989
    Fixed a bug in tvmark wherein circles were not being drawn if they
    were partially off the image in the x dimension.

noao$proto/tvmark/
    Davis, June1, 1989
    A labeling capability has been added to tvmark. If the label parameter
    is turned on tvmark will label objects with the string in the third
    column of the coordinate file.

noao$proto/tvmark/
    Davis,  May 25, 1989
    The problem reported by phil wherein TVMARK would go into an infinite
    loop if it encountered a blank line has been fixed.

    Valdes, May 23, 1989
    Complex images are supported with the thresholds being the magnitude
    of the complex values and the replacement value specified as real
    and imaginary.

noao$proto/tvmark
    Davis,  May 22, 1989
    The new task TVMARK was added to the proto package.

noao$proto/imedit/
    Davis,  May 22, 1989
    The new task IMEDIT was added to the proto package.

noao$proto/t_binfil.x
    Rooke, Apr 28, 1989
    After allocating temporary storage for header bytes in IRAFIL, the code
    was then reading those bytes instead into pixel storage, resulting in
    a segmentation violation if header > row of pixels (found by Jim
    Klavetter).

noao$proto/epix/epgdata.x
    Valdes, Mar 20, 1989
    Limit checking on the requested data region was wrong.  User would get
    out of bounds message if the line desired was greater than the number
    of columns.
 
noao$proto/t_bscale.x
    Davis, Feb 7, 1989
    Fixed a memory corruption error in bscale. If a user specified a section
    using the section parameter, the task was overflowing the data array
    by trying to read beyond the boundary of the section. 

    Fixed a floating divide by zero problem in the computation of
    step sizes when a specified section was only one pixel
    wide in a given dimension.

noao$proto/
    Davis, Jan 26, 1989
    A "pixel out of bounds" error was fixed in the task IRMATCH2D. This
    would occur if nxsub != nysub and for certain combination of corner
    and order. This bug has been fixed.

noao$proto/
    Davis, Nov 8, 1988
    The two prototype image intensity matching tasks IRMATCH1D and IRMATCH2D
    have been added to the proto package. See the help pages for further
    details.

noao$proto/t_irmosaic.x
    Davis, Jul 23, 1988
    The number of columns and rows between adjacent subrasters in the output
    image produced by IRMOSAIC was incorrect if nxoverlap or nyoverlap were
    less than -1.

noao$proto/t_imslice.x
    Davis, Jul 8, 1988
    A new task imslice has been added to the proto package. IMSLICE reduces
    an n-dimensional image to a list of (n-1)-dimensional images.

    Added the absolute value function.  Combined the different functions
    into one procedure.

noao$proto/t_mkhistogram.x
    Davis, Feb 5, 1988
    A new task mkhistogram has been added to the proto package. Mkhistogram
    will task a stream of data and list or plot the histogram of the data.

noao$proto/t_irmosaic.x
    Davis, Feb 3, 1988
    1. A new parameter "subtract" has been added to the IRMOSAIC task. If
    the "median" parameter is yes then IRMOSAIC will subtract the median
    from each subraster before adding it to the output image mosaic.

noao$proto
    Davis, Dec 8, 1987
    1. Two new tasks IRMOSAIC and IRALIGN have been added to the PROTO
    package. IRMOSAIC takes an ordered list of input images and places them
    on a grid in an output image. Options exist to order the input list
    by row, column or in a raster pattern starting at any of the four
    corners of the output image. Adjacent subrasters may be overlapped or
    separated by a specified number of columns and rows. Positions of objects
    which occur in adjacent subrasters can be marked using for example
    the sun imtool facility and centered using the APPHOT center routine.
    IRALIGN takes the mosaiced image and the coordinate list and produces an
    output image where all the individual subrasters have been aligned with
    respect to some reference subraster.  These two tasks are most useful for
    images which already lie approximately on a grid.

noao$proto/t_bscale.x +
noao$proto/bscale.par +
noao$proto/doc/bscale.hlp +
    Valdes, October 7, 1988
    A new task to compute to scale images by a zero point and scale factor
    has been added.  The zero point and scale factor can be chosen as the
    mean, median, or mode of the images.

noao$proto/doc/replicate.hlp -
    Valdes, June 4, 1987
    1.  Deleted this obsolete file.

noao$proto/toonedspec.x
noao$proto/doc/toonedspec.hlp
    Valdes, April 27, 1987
    1.  The output spectra are now of type real regardless of the input
	pixel type.  This change was made to avoid fix point exceptions
	on AOS/VS IRAF when summing enough lines to overflow the input
	pixel type.  On the other IRAF systems integer overflows only cause
	erroneous output but no error.

noao$proto/fixline.gx
    Valdes, April 27, 1987
    1.  The interpolation weights when interpolating across lines were
	being truncated and producing approximately correct values
	but not correct interpolation.  The weights are now not truncated.

noao$proto/join.cl
    Hammond, March 10, 1987
    1. Added script task JOIN, which joins two lists line by line.

noao$proto/t_imstack.x
    Valdes, March 3, 1987
    1.  The input images being stacked were not being closed after they
	were added to the output image.

noao$proto/imrep.gx
    Valdes, February 5, 1987
    1.  There was a problem in AOS iraf because of an attempt to convert
	a real INDEF to a short value.  The routine was modified to attempt
	the conversion only if the value is not INDEF.

noao$proto/t_imstack.x
noao$proto/doc/imstack.hlp
    Valdes, October 8, 1986
    1.  Modified IMSTACK to use image templates instead of file templates.
	All image tasks should use the image template package for consistency.
    2.  Modified the help page.  One of the examples was incorrect.

noao$proto/imfunction.x
    Valdes, October 8, 1986
    1.  Doug Tody added the square root function.  I don't know the
	details of the revision.

noao$proto/imlog.gx
noao$proto/imdex.gx +
noao$proto/funcs.x -
noao$proto/doc/imfunction.hlp
    Valdes, September 9, 1986
    1.  Added the "dex" function which is the inverse of the existing "log"
	function.
    2.  The help page was revised.

proto$toonedspec:  Valdes, June 16, 1986
    1.  Added new task TOONEDSPEC to convert columns or lines of 2D
	spectra to 1D spectra.  A manual page was also added.  This
	is a prototype.  The task or it's function will eventually
	move to the TWODSPEC package.

======================
Package reorganization
======================

local$dsttoiraf:  Valdes, April 7, 1986
    1.  The task resides now on NOAO/VMS SKD:[LOCAL.DAOP]

local$t_imstack.x:  Valdes, April 6, 1986
local$doc/imstack.hlp:  Valdes, April 6, 1986
    1.  Removed warning message about mixed datatypes in IMSTACK.
    2.  Updated help page for IMSTACK.

local$dsttoiraf:  Valdes, April 3, 1986
    1.  Added NOAO foreign task to convert DST (DAO) format images to
	IRAF images.  This task is only available on the NOAO/VMS cluster.
	Attempting to run this on any other system will fail.

local$irafil:  Valdes, April 3, 1986
    1.  George Jacoby added the task IRAFIL to convert integer byte
	pixel data to an IRAF image.  It is an attempt to have a general
	dataio conversion for foreign format images.
