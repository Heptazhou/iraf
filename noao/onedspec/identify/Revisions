    Package was rewritten to use a structure rather than a common block.
    This was a major change though the logic was not changed. (4/7/88)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

noao$onedspec/identify/iddb.x
    DBGETR was declared as real for the new shift parameter causing a wrong
    wavelength scale to appear. (12/22/87 Valdes)

noao$onedspec/identify/*.x

    The package was restructure to use a data structure instead of common
    blocks for sharing data between procedures.  (12/18/87 Valdes)

noao$onedspec/identify/identify.x
noao$onedspec/identify/reidentify.x
noao$onedspec/identify/idgraph.x
    1.  The XTOOLS change to XT_MK1D now permits the sections "column 51"
	and "column 051" to be recognized identically.
    2.  REIDENTIFY now aborts with a useful error message if their is not
	database record for the reference image instead of later causing
	a segmentation error.
    3.  IDENTIFY can now plot in point mode using the GTOOLS commands if
	desired.
    (11/9/97 Valdes)

noao$onedspec/identify/*
noao$onedspec/identify/iddoshift.x +
    Added shift options to IDENTIFY and a refit option to REIDENTIFY.
    This allows maintaining the same coordinate function with an additive
    shift. (11/3/87 Valdes)

noao$onedspec/identify/ididentify.x
noao$onedspec/identify/idlinelist.x
noao$onedspec/identify/idnewfeature.x
    Valdes, April 15, 1987
    1.  Added bell if feature not found with 'm'.
    2.  When automatically identifying lines, 'l' it now requires a new line
	to be within the matching distance relative to the current fit and
	if two centers are withing "minsep" then the closest match to the
	user coordinate is selected.
    3.  Default initial graph for fitting is residuals vs. wavelength.

noao$onedspec/identify/idreidentify.x
noao$onedspec/identify/idfitdata.x
noao$onedspec/identify/idcolon.x
    Valdes, March 5, 1987
    1.  IDENTIFY now prints a warning about a nonmonotonic coordinate
	solution.
    2.  Changes were made to not print the current feature when error
	messages are printed thus giving the user a change to read them.
    3.  When attempting to change images to a nonexistant image
	the immap was improperly error checked.  This could result in
	fatal errors (particularly on VMS).

noao$onedspec/identify
noao$onedspec/identify/icfit	-
    Valdes, February 20, 1987
    1.  Made required GIO changes.
    2.  Elliminated local copy of ICFIT.  This was done by modifying the
	ICFIT package to add a parameter to set the ICFIT cursor help file
	and adding the velocity axis type explicitly to the package.

noao$onedspec/identify/idcolon.x
noao$onedspec/identify/ididentify.x
    Valdes, January 16, 1987
    1.  Colon command dictionary and switch rewritten to use macro definitions.
    2.  ? help facility rewritten to use system paging facility instead of ad
	hoc menu facility.

noao$onedspec/identify/idreidentify.x
    Valdes, December 3, 1986
    1.  REIDENTIFY was not correctly tracking when there was no fit.
	75: FIT(j) = FIT(i)	==>	FIT(j) = fit

noao$onedspec/identify/idlinelist.x
    Valdes, November 25, 1986
    1.  It used to be that if there were no coordinate list then the
	default user coordinate was the pixel coordinate.  This changed
	at some point.  This has been fixed.

noao$onedspec/identify/identify.x
    Valdes, November 21, 1986
    1.  The common variable labels is now initialized every time the
	task runs.

noao$onedspec/identify/ididentify.x
    Valdes, October 1, 1986
    1.  Minor bug fix.  An example of the bug:
	"Number of features reidentified = 37 out of 21" should be
	"Number of features reidentified = 21 out of 37".

noao$onedspec/identify/reidentify.x
    Valdes, September 25, 1986
    1.  REIDENTIFY was passing a constant 0. to ID_REIDENTIFY which expects
	a double.  Replaced 0. with "double (0.)" as the argument.
	This caused a failure in the AOS IRAF.

noao$onedspec/identify/xtpage.x +
noao$onedspec/identify/xtmenu.x +
noao$onedspec/identify/ididentify.x
    Valdes, September 5, 1986
    1.  Added paging and menu features to '?' help.

noao$onedspec/identify/iddofit.x
noao$onedspec/identify/idgdata.x
noao$onedspec/identify/idfitdata.x
    Valdes, August 22, 1986
    1.  ICFIT no longer inherits the window from IDENTIFY.  Entering ICFIT
	will do autoscaling.
    2.  IDENTIFY now uses the image header coordinate information if there
	is no database dispersion solution.  The parameters used are
	CRPIX, CRVAL, and CDELT.  This allows IDENTIFY to be used with
	linearized spectra in the ONEDSPEC related packages.

    Valdes, August 18, 1986
    1.  IDENTIFY and REIDENTIFY modified to include a detection threshold
	parameter for feature centering.
    2.  The help pages were updated.

====================================
Version 2.3 Release, August 18, 1986
====================================

identify$idmark.x: Valdes, August 11, 1986
    1.  Modified mark to select the minimum or maximum of two neighboring
	points about the line center to define the minimum or maximum
	of the absorption or emission line.  Previously it chose the nearest
	point to the center.
    2.  Modified the local version of ICFIT to contain only the double
	precision versions used in IDENTIFY.  This will save some space
	in the executable.

identify$icgfit.gx:  Valdes, August 7, 1986
    1.  The 'c' key was using a fixed format inappropriate for some types
	of data.  The formats where changed to general %g format.

identify$idmark.x: Valdes, August 8, 1986
    1.  The optional labels have been adjusted to be half size and
	to have a path of up.  Note that on a vt640 the default text
	quality uses hardware generation so this change will not be
	visible unless you reset the text quality to high.
    2.  The size of the ticks and the gaps have changed slightly.

identify$icfit/icgfit.gx:  Valdes, August 7, 1986
    1.  A bug in the generic code was causing a double to be
	passed to gt_setr which caused the windowing to be wrong.
	This bug appeared only in the SUN.
    2.  A bug in writing the current key definition with the 'g' key was
	fixed.  This bug appeared only in the SUN.

identify$: Valdes, July 3, 1986
    1.  Modified package to use new ICFIT package.
    2.  Changed coordinate list parameter to onedstds$henear.dat.
    3.  Updated help page for IDENTIFY to refect new default coordlist.

identify$identify.x,reidentify.x,idgetim.x:  Valdes, July 1, 1986
    1.  Replaced calls to imtgetim with idgetim.  Idgetim calls
	imtgetim to get next image name but it then removes any
	image extension.  This is necessary to prevent having two
	different names by which an image may be identified in the
	database.

=====================================
STScI Pre-release and SUN 2.3 Release
=====================================
	
identify$ididentify.x: Valdes, June 11, 1986
    1.  Windowing key 'w' added.
    2.  Help page updated to reflect the 'w' and 'y' keys.

identify$ididentify.x: Valdes, June 9, 1986
    1.  Changed Memr to Memd in 'y' option.

identify$reidentify.x: Valdes, June 2, 1986
    1.  Changed from file template to image template.

identify$reidentify.x: Valdes, May 8, 1986
    1.  Set log output to be flushed with every line written instead of
	being buffered.

identify$idlog.x: Valdes, May 1, 1986
    1.  Column headings were adjusted.

identify: Valdes, March 26, 1986
    1.  Fixed bug in IDENTIFY which failed to add new lines with the 'l'
	command when the initial wavelength axis was pixels.

identify: Valdes, March 24, 1986
    1.  Fixed minor bug in REIDENTIFY.  It was calling IC_FREE instead
	of IC_FREED (the new double precision version) while the rest
	of the package was in double precision.

identify: Valdes, March 14, 1986
    1.  Modified IDENTIFY to store the line list internally instead of
	scanning the line list file every time.

identify:  Valdes, March 13, 1986
    1.  Modified IDENTIFY and REIDENTIFY to be double precision.  It uses
	the double precision ICFIT and CURFIT procedures.
    2.  The help pages for IDENTIFY and REIDENTIFY were updated for the
	changes since Release 2.2

identify:  Valdes, Feb 27, 1986:
    1.  IDENTIFY and REIDENTIFY have been modified to do shifts in user
	coordinates instead of pixel coordinates.  This applies to the 's'
	and 'x' keys in IDENTIFY and to REIDENTIFY.  The shift specified in
	REIDENTIFY is now in user coordinates.  Unless otherwise specified
	the shifts printed by these tasks are in user coordinates instead
	of pixels.
    2.  A new key has been added to IDENTIFY.  The key 'r' resets the
	current feature to the position of the cursor.  This replaces the
	need to mark the new position and then delete the old position.
    3.  The output of 's' and 'x' in IDENTIFY is slightly different.
