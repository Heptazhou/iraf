Subject: IMSHIFT behavior
Status: R


Lindsey, here are some random comments and questions about IMSHIFT:

     IMSHIFT will produce the following behavior if a shift is specified
that is larger than the image to be shifted (at least on orion):

    cl> images
    im> unlearn imshift
    im> imshift dev$pix testimg 513.0 0.0
    Error shifting image: dev$pix
    Warning: ISHIFTXY: X shift out of bounds.
    im> dir testimg.imh
    testimg.imh  
    im> imhead testimg.img lo+ user-
    testimg[512,512][short]: m51  B  600s
        No bad pixels, no histogram, min=unknown, max=unknown
        Line storage mode, physdim [512,512], length of user area 1459 s.u.

I don't think the header should be created in this case.

     If using a nearest neighbor interpolant is equivalent to rounding
the shifts first and using the integral shift branch of the routine,
shouldn't the code be written to do exactly that?

     Is there any change in the status of using lists of shifts for inputs?
