			Onedspec Review Meeting
				Agenda
			       25-Sep-84


1. Package Requirements (initial version of package)

	1.1 Basic ONEDSPEC Reduction Functions Required

		- linelist preparation
		- dispersion solution
		- dispersion modification
		- flux calibration
		- extinction correction
		- other ?

		- no analysis functions (radial velocities, eq. widths) in
		  initial package ?

	    Input is assumed to have been corrected for the peculiarities
	    of the individual detector, i.e., flat fielding, coincidence
	    correction, extraction, etc. are dealt with in the IMRED package
	    but not in ONEDSPEC itself.

	    Output is typically a linearized, photometrically calibrated
	    spectra.

	1.2 Related IMRED Packages are initially required for the
	    Following Instruments

		- IIDS
		- IRS
		- ?


2. Module Specifications

	2.1 Linelist Preparation

		- use LISTS format text files?

		- should we add a dispersion solution capability to the
		  program used to prepare linelists, to aid in line
		  identification and rejection of misidentified or blended
		  lines?
	
	2.2 Dispersion Solution

		- interactive solution is essential for difficult cases,
		  but should it not be possible to set up a batch run with
		  a set of similar spectra and a linelist identifiying the
		  lines to be used and giving starting line centers.

		- is it desirable to perform the second order correction
		  as a second, optional step?

		- curve types

	2.3 Dispersion Modification

		- interpolators

	2.3 Flux Calibration

	2.4 Extinction Correction


3. general discussion
