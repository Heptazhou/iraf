NAME
sflip -- Flip the dispersion direction of spectra
.ih
USAGE
sflip input records output start_rec
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The root file name for the input records to be flipped.
.le
.ls records
The range of spectra to be included in the flip operation.
Each range item will be appended to the root name to form an
image file name.
.le
.ls output
Root name of the output flipped spectra.
.le
.ls start_rec
Each new spectrum created has "output" has its root name and a 
trailing number appended starting with "start_rec". Subsequent
output images will have an incremented trailing number.

DESCRIPTION
The order of the pixels in the input spectra is reversed so that the
last pixel becomes the first and the first pixel becomes the last.
The header parameters describing the dispersion are also modified to
maintain the dispersion coordinates of the pixels.  This task is used
to flip spectra which have decreasing wavelength with increasing pixel
coordinate to the standard orientation of increasing wavelength
required by many of the tasks in the \fBonedspec\fR package and to
flip processed spectra to the the wavelength orientation desired by
user.

EXAMPLES
The following example flips the spectra pds.0001 to pds.0005 which have
been dispersion corrected with \fBdispcor\fR such that wavelength decreases
with increasing pixel coordinate.
