NAME
ccdtime -- compute observing time required specified photometry
.ih
USAGE
ccdtime magnitude precision
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls magnitude
The UBVRI magnitude of the observation.
.le
.ls precision
The photometric precision desired (e.g. 0.01 for "1 percent").
.le
.ls aperture = 0.9
The telescope aperture (meters).
.le
.ls fratio = 7.5
The telescope focal ratio.
.le
.ls seeing = 1.5
The seeing conditions (arcsec).
.le
.ls dark = 0.0
The dark count rate (ADU/sec).
.le
.ls isum = 1
The on-chip binning factor (assumed to affect both x and y directions).
.le
.ls chip = "RCA1"
The name of the CCD detector.  Currently only RCA1, RCA2, and TI
are recognized.

DESCRIPTION
The time is computed which is required to observe a star of the specified
magnitude to produce the specified photometric precision.
Times are given for each of the UBVRI filters. The user may additionally
specify the telescope aperture, focal ratio, and seeing conditions,
and the detector parameters such as dark current and on-chip binning.

The program currently recognizes three KPNO universal dewar detectors:
RCA1 (the "imaging" chip), RCA2 (the "spectroscopic" chip), and the TI2.
See NOAO Newsletter No. 8 (Dec. 1986), pages 18 and 19, for
sensitivity characteristics for these chips.  Read noise is taken as 75
for the RCA chips and 8.6 for TI2.

The photometry is assumed to be under optimal conditions; the sky
is perfectly flattened, reasonably but not maximally dark,
there is no crowding, and an aperture
twice the seeing size can be used.  Within these assumptions, exposure
times derived are probably accurate to about 30%, and so if 
estimates for CCDs other than those listed are needed, choosing a 
similar chip will give indicative results.
