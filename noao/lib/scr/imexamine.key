				COLON COMMANDS

Explicit image coordinates may be entered using the colon command syntax:

	:column line key

where column and line are the image coordinates and the key is one
of the cursor keys.  A special syntax for line or column plots is also
available as :c# or :l# where # is a column or line and no space is
allowed.

Other colon commands set or show parameters governing the plots and other
features of the task.  Each graph type has it's own set of parameters.
When a parameter applies to more than one graph the current graph is assumed.
If the current graph is not applicable then a warning is given.  The
"eparam" and "unlearn" commands may be used to change many parameters and
without an argument the current graph parameters are modified while with
the graph key as an argument the appropriate parameter set is modified.
In the list below the graph key(s) to which a parameter applies are shown.
