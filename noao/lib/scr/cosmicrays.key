   COSMIC RAY DETECTION AND REPLACEMENT:  INTERACTIVE CURSOR COMMANDS

  The graph shows the ratio of the mean background subtracted flux within the
detection window (excluding the candidate cosmic ray and the second brightest
pixel) to the flux of the candidate cosmic ray pixel as a function of the
mean flux.  Both coordinates have been multiplied by 100 so the ratio is in
precent.  The peaks of extended objects have high flux ratios while true
cosmic rays have low ratios.  The main purpose of this step is to set the
flux ratio threshold for discriminating stars and galaxies.  The cursor
keys are:

d	Mark candidate for replacement (applys to '+' points)
q	Quit and replace the selected pixels
r	Redraw the graph
s	Make a surface plot for the candidate nearest the cursor
t	Set the flux ratio threshold at the y cursor position
u	Mark candidate to not be replaced (applys to 'x' points)
w	Adjust the graph window (see GTOOLS)

There are no colon commands except those for the windowing options (type
:\help or see GTOOLS).
