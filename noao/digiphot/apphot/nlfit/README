This subdirectory contains the routines in the NLFIT nonlinear least squares
fitting package. The routines use the Levenberg-Marquardt method as described
in Numerical Recipes to solve the set of nonlinear equations. The user must
supply two routines. The first evaluates the function in terms of
its parameters and the second evaluates the function and its derivatives
in terms of its parameters. The functions used by the apphot package can
be found in the aputil subdirectory. The user must also supply a fitting
tolerance and the maximum number of iterations. Not all the parameters
need be fit at each execution of the package. 

The entry points into the nlfit package are listed below. The error codes
returned by nlfit are listed in ../lib/nlfit.h.
