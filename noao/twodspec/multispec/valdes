Hi everyone,

I'm alive and well (electronically) again in New Jersey.  My mail is now
beinging forwarded to me here (charm!valdes for direct addressing) and I
can dial in as necessary.  It would be nice if I could be added to the
mail list for IRAF mail and SITE mail (I still have to wade through the
last two weeks of mail).  I got my mail concerning the various bugs and
I will respond in due course.

We packed up all our stuff in our house and put them in our garage on
Saturday the 30th with help from Paul Hintzen with the heavy stuff.  We
worked from 7am to 10pm.  You never realize how much stuff you have and
we were pretty ruthless throwing stuff away as time wore on.  I filled
1.5 dumpsters!  It was so much work I started to regret the idea of leaving.
It was also tough to cram the things we wanted for a year into the car.
However, we finally finished and collapsed at a nearby motel.

Our stay in Houston with Susan's parents was nice.  We spent two days in
a beach house near Galveston on the Gulf.  That was really great!  We
had good weather the whole time as we followed a high pressure across
the country.  We spent a day in New Orleans's French Quarter and took a
steamboat trip on the Mississippi.  Then we had a day in Atlanta with
family.  We drove north along the Applachians and had our last fun stop
in Gettysburg.  We arrived in New Jersey on the 14th and I reported for
work today.  The driving was tiring and Gabriel didn't much like his car
seat.  However, he only cried 10 minutes each time we put him in.  All
in all it was a nice vacation.

The following is the present contact info which may change.
