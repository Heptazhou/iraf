This directory contains miscellaneous tools written in the spp language.
While not really system routines or mathematical library routines, these
library routines are nonetheless sufficiently general purpose to justify
making them publically available.  Reference library "libtools.a" (-ltools
on the xc command line) to access these routines.

IRAF Group members are encouraged to add to the tools.  To install a new
tool: (1) copy the .x source into the directory, (2) Enter the name of
each file followed by any dependency files into the Makelib file, and (3) 
enter the UNIX command "mklib -O".  This will compile the new modules and
add them to the "libtools.a" library.
