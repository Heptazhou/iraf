This FFTPACK version 5.1 was written at NCAR mostly by Paul Swarztrauber as a follow-on 
to the original FFTPACK which he wrote in the 1970's. The original version of FFTPACK 
is included in the FISHPACK library.

After you have downloaded fftpack5.1.tar.gz into a clean directory on your Unix or 
Linux system, execute these commands:

gunzip fftpack5.1.tar.gz
tar xvf fftpack5.1.tar
cd fftpack/doc

In directory fftpack/doc, follow instructions in the README_FFTPACK5.1 file for more 
information, including the caveats.  Then use your browser to open and navigate 
FFTPACK5.1.html, following the links to view instructions for user-level routines.
