DESCRIPTION
These routines return a boolean value indicating whether the
relevant parameter, task or package has been defined.
A task becomes defined when the package to which it belongs is "loaded"
by entering the name of the package as a command, or whenever a \fItask\fR
declaration is input to the CL.  A parameter becomes defined when the
task to which it belongs is defined; the task need not be currently
executing for its parameters to be defined.  When a package is exited,
e.g., after entry of the \fIbye\fR command, all the task and parameter
declarations for the package are discarded.

EXAMPLES
1. Test if a task exists.

.nf
	cl> if (deftask ("system.page"))
	>>>	print ("task page exists")
	>>> else
	>>>	print ("task page not found")
	task page exists
	cl>
.fi

2. Add the value of the named parameter into a sum, but only if the parameter
exists (the example is for a script).

.nf
	sum = 0
	for (i=0;  i <= 10;  i+=1) {
	    parname = "data" // i
	    if (defpar (parname)
		sum += parname
	}
