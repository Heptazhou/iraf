NAME
.nf
fprint -- print to a parameter
print  -- print to the standard output
.fi
.ih
USAGE
.nf
print  expr [expr ...]
fprint param expr [expr ...]
.fi
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls expr
Any expression, the string value of which is to be printed.
.le
.ls param
\fIFprint\fR will deposit the output string in the value field of this
parameter.

DESCRIPTION
The \fIprint\fR and \fIfprint\fR commands format a line of text and write
it to either the standard output or in the case of \fIfprint\fR,
the p_value field of the named parameter.  The output is free format although
spaces may be specifically inserted (as quoted string constants) to make the
output easier to read.  One space is automatically inserted after each
numeric argument; this can be defeated by coercing the argument to a string
with the \fIstr\fR intrinsic function.  A newline is automatically output
at the end of the output line.  I/O redirection may be used with \fIprint\fR
to write to a file.

Compute mode (a parenthesized argument list) is recommended for this task
to avoid surprises.

EXAMPLES
1. Print the name of the current terminal.

	cl> print ("terminal = ", envget ("terminal"))

2. Output a blank line on the standard output, e.g., in a script.

	print ("")

3. Format a command and send it to the host system.  In this example,
"fname" is a string valued parameter.

	cl> print ("!dir/full ", fname) | cl

4. Write to a file.

.nf
	for (x=1.;  x < 1E5;  x *= 10) 
	    print ("the sqrt of ", x, "is ", sqrt(x), >> "output")
.fi

BUGS
The \fIfprint\fR task is not very useful since the same thing can be
accomplished by string concatenation and assignment.
