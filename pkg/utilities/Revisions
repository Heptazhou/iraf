utilities$t_curfit.x
    For list input only, curfit now sorts the input array before fitting.
    Sorted data is required by the rg_ranges procedure (even in the
    default case of sample=*) or else data points will be ommitted from
    the fit.  (24/6/88 ShJ)

    Davis, December 2, 1987
    1. Added a new parameter weighting to the curfit task. The four weighting
    options are uniform, user, statistical and instrumental. The weights in
    the four cases are 1.0, user input, 1/y and 1/sigmay ** 2. In the latter
    case the weight that the user supplies is interpreted as sigmay. All
    four options are available if input is from a list or STDIN. If input
    is from an image section only the uniform and statistical options are
    available.

utilities$t_polyfit.x
    Davis, November 23, 1987.
    1. Added a new parameter weighting to the polyfit task. The three
    weighting options are instrumental, uniform and statistical. The
    weights in the three cases are 1./sigy ** 2, 1.0 and 1/y consistent
    with the Bevington definitions. If the weighting is instrumental
    the user must supply the error in y as well as x and y.

    1.  Required GIO changes.

utilities$t_curfit.x, curfit.gx:  Valdes, July 3, 1986
    1.  Modified CURFIT to use new ICFIT package.

Task:  Curfit

1.  The CURFIT task has been modified to allow switching between single
and double precision calculations.  Generally double precision is used
but this task provides a convenient test facility for testing changes
in the mathematical routines or which precision is appropriate for a
new task being developed.

2.  The help page was updated.

Task:  Curfit

1. A new task, Curfit, has been installed.  It is the cl interface to
   the curfit package and allows for interactive fitting of functions
   to list or image data.  The function types supported are Legendre
   or Chebyshev polynomials and linear or cubic splines.

Task:	Polyfit

1.  Polyfit no longer gets a floating divide by zero when a linear fit
    has a correlation = 1.  The problem was in the error calculation (ftest)
    portion of the Bevington routine regres.  This problem was reported
    by ST.
