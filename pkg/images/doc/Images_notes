Notes on the \fBimages\fR Package


    The following manual pages incorporate the last recommended changes
until the \fBimages\fR package is systematically designed.  Most tasks
are essentially unchanged.  The following summarizes the recommended
changes:

.ls o
Specification of defaulting output titles and pixel datatypes to be that of
an input image is made with the null ("") string.
.le
.ls o
The result of using an output image name which is the same as an input
image name, except in tasks in which in place operations make sense
(imtranspose, flatten, imreplace, etc) is assumed to be handled by IMIO
using the \fIclobber\fR parameter.  Thus, IMIO must handle the problem
of "a + b = a" in \fBimarith\fR.
.le
.ls o
The BUG section specifies that using an existing image name when \fIclobber\fR
is yes is not properly handled by IMIO at this time.
.le
.ls o
The new image templates are used.
.le
.ls o
The task \fIimtranspose\fR allows in place operations by using a null ("")
output image name or if the input and output image names are the same.
.le
.ls o
Eliminate the task \fBimdivide\fR since its functions are provided in the
\fBimredtools\fR package in the task \fBflatten\fR.
.le
