IRAF$DEV - The DEV Directory (Aug 1986)

    This directory contains device descriptor tables and host system interface
information for the various devices accessed by IRAF.  With the exception of
the cache[gt].dat files, all these files are read at runtime hence new devices
can be interfaced without a sysgen in most cases.

    cacheg.dat, cachet.dat
	SPP include files, referenced in TTY, used to cache graphcap and
	termcap device entries for fast access.

    devices
	Maps the logical (IRAF) device names of any allocatable devices to
	host system names.  Primary use is for magtape devices.

    edt.ed, emacs.ed, vi.ed
	Read by EDIT, EPARAM, and EHISTORY to determine the editor language
	and the host command to be used to call the host editor.

    graphcap
	Device information for all graphics terminals, plotters, and image
	displays.  If an entry is also in the cache file `cacheg.dat', the
	cache must be rebuilt before changes will take effect.

    help.db
	The compiled HELP database.  Tells HELP what packages and modules help
	is available for, and the names of the associaated help files.

    hostlogin, hosts, uhosts
	Network interface files.  Describe the nodes on the local network
	and how to talk to them.

    null
	The dev$null file.  I am not sure an actual file entry is still
	required for this special file, but it was in the beginning.

    pix.hhh, pix.imh, pix.pix
	The standard test image, dev$pix.imh, and the STF template header
	file, dev$pix.hhh, required to propagate the special VMS file type
	required by the STF format to new image header files.

    termcap
	Device information for all terminals and printers.  The printer
	info should be moved out into a PRINTCAP file at some point.
	If an entry is also in the cache file `cachet.dat', the cache must
	be rebuilt before changes will take effect.

    vdmfile.gki, vdmplot.gki
	Standard test GKI metacode files.  VDMFILE contains several test
	frames, VDMPLOT contains a single, more complicated plot, used to
	test and compare the resolution of different graphics devices.
