# HOSTLOGIN -- Default public logins on the IRAF host machines.  This file is
# accessed only if the user does not have a comparable .irafhosts file in their
# local host system login directory.
#
# Syntax:	node : loginname password
#
# Special	node      = "*"		matches any node
# syntax:	loginname = "<user>"	stands for the username on local node
#		password  = "?"		means prompt for the password
#
# Note that prompting interactively for the password may lead to a situation
# where two processes are simultaneously trying to read from the terminal,
# if the network connection is made in a background job.  Omitting the login
# name and password fields prevents network access to the indicated node(s).

*	: <user> ?
