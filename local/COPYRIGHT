	Added a copyright notice to all these core system source files.
	The notice reads as follows:  "Copyright(c) 1986 Association of
	Universities for Research in Astronomy Inc".  We also plan to add
	a file called COPYRIGHT later stating the terms of the copyright
	and associated licensing agreement for the software.  The intent
	is only to protect the software from unauthorized commercial
	exploitation, and the copyright grants, or will grant, the right to
	copy, modify, and redistribute the software provided the original
	copyright notice remains intact, and the rights we grant are passed
	on with the software.  We wish to prevent others from copyrighting
	the software in their own name and possibly taking away the rights
	we grant with the software.

	This is not to say that we want to encourage people to modify and
	redistribute IRAF software, we merely want them to have the legal
	right to do so if they feel they need to.  The NOAO packages are not
	similarly copyrighted at the present time although that may change
	in the future.  (6/21)
